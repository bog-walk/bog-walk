<h3 align="center">Hi, I'm Chantal :maple_leaf:</h3>
<p align="center">In 2018 I was an equine veterinarian :racehorse: completing a surgical internship.</p>
<p align="center">Now I look at fewer x-rays & do a lot more maths.</p>
<p align="center">I built a website!:tada: It's got the blog posts that I write when I'm feeling nostalgic for academia.</p>
<p align="center">Kotlin is very much my main enthusiasm, but I'm trying to grow my Python and C++ skills :seedling:.</p>
<p align="center">Feel free to let me know if you have any tips, questions, or suggestions for improvement in any of my repos.</p>
<p align="center">Or if you just want to know what getting an upper-cut from a 600kg animal feels like :upside_down_face:.</p>
